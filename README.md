# Horiseon Landing Page Refactor
The purpose of this project is to fix, tidy up, and organize the index.html and style.css files for the Horiseon landing page.

## Index File
The index file has been slightly reorganized to be easier to follow, which includes spacing within and between sections in the body, as well as adding comments to indicate what part of the landing page you're viewing. 

All of the links in the file have been checked and are now functioning properly.

Many of the \<div> tags have been renamed for more appropriate content management. \<section> and \<nav> tags have been introduced as well as \<header> and \<footer>.

Some of the class selectors were changed or removed to reduce the number of references to the .css file.

## Style File
Several selectors in the .css file have been removed and condensed to reduce the amount of duplicate code.

The file was also reorganized so selectors that reference the same section in the index file are grouped together.

Comments were added to identify each corresponding section in the index file.
